n8p29rbm,,WHO,Making Waves Perspectives of Modelling and Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in Aquatic Environment for COVID-19 Pandemic,,,,unk,"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the aquatic environment pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic has been a global concern. Though SARS-CoV-2 is known as a respiratory virus, its detection in faecal matter and wastewater demonstrates its enteric involvement resulting in vulnerable aquatic environment. Here, we provide the latest updates on wastewater-based epidemiology, which is gaining interest in the current situation as a unique tool of surveillance and monitoring of the disease. Transport pathways with its migration through wastewater to surface and subsurface waters, probability of infectivity and ways of inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 are discussed in detail. Epidemiological models, especially compartmental projections, have been explained with an emphasis on its limitation and the assumptions on which the future predictions of disease propagation are based. Besides, this review covers various predictive models to track and project disease spread in the future and gives an insight into the probability of a future outbreak of the disease.",2020,"Kumar, Manish; Mohapatra, Sanjeeb; Mazumder, Payal; Singh, Ashwin; Honda, Ryo; Lin, Chuxia; Kumari, Rina; Goswami, Ritusmita; Jha, Pawan Kumar; Vithanage, Meththika; Kuroda, Keisuke",Curr Pollut Rep,,#754102,,,,,221618406,,make wave perspect of model and monitor of sar cov in aquat environ for covid 19 pandem preval of sar cov in the aquat environ pertain to the covid 19 pandem has been global concern though sar cov is known as respiratori virus it detect in faecal matter and wastewat demonstr it enter involv result in vulner aquat environ here we provid the latest updat on wastewat base epidemiolog which is gain interest in the current situat as uniqu tool of surveil and monitor of the diseas transport pathway with it migrat through wastewat to surfac and subsurfac water probabl of infect and way of inactiv of sar cov are discuss in detail epidemiolog model especi compartment project have been explain with an emphasi on it limit and the assumpt on which the futur predict of diseas propag are base besid this review cover various predict model to track and project diseas spread in the futur and give an insight into the probabl of futur outbreak of the diseas,making wave perspective of modelling and monitoring of sars cov in aquatic environment for covid 19 pandemic prevalence of sars cov in the aquatic environment pertaining to the covid 19 pandemic ha been global concern though sars cov is known a respiratory virus it detection in faecal matter and wastewater demonstrates it enteric involvement resulting in vulnerable aquatic environment here we provide the latest update on wastewater based epidemiology which is gaining interest in the current situation a unique tool of surveillance and monitoring of the disease transport pathway with it migration through wastewater to surface and subsurface water probability of infectivity and way of inactivation of sars cov are discussed in detail epidemiological model especially compartmental projection have been explained with an emphasis on it limitation and the assumption on which the future prediction of disease propagation are based besides this review cover various predictive model to track and project disease spread in the future and give an insight into the probability of future outbreak of the disease,"  (0, 297980)	0.1050596547037212

However, perceptions and understandings of substance use in the sport and fitness world are directly related to those of substance use in the non-sport world. One way the gap between sport and non-sport substance use research can be bridged is to consider sport risk and enabling environments. Similar to non-sport contexts and drug use, it is important to analyse the environments in which doping occurs. This approach allows us to examine the dynamic interplay between risk and enabling factors, as the enabling environment shifts in response to changes produced in the risk environment, and vice versa. There are models of sport environments that have proven effective at both enabling doping by athletes and reducing harms to athletes: systematic doping. This article will use secondary literature in order to review and analyse known cases of systematic doping through the risk and enabling environment frameworks. We argue that these systems responded to anti-doping in ways that protected athletes from the risk factors established by anti-doping policy and that athletes suffered most when these systems were revealed, exposing athletes to the full range of doping harms. Further, we argue that risks within these systems (i.e. extortion, bullying) resulted from the broader prohibitive sport environment that forces doping underground and allows such abuses to occur.",2020-08-04,"Henning, April; McLean, Katherine; Andreasson, Jesper; Dimeo, Paul",Int J Drug Policy,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e754d2be7b56966da14c79a18cded6c43f80671f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7402240.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095539592030236X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32768155/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S095539592030236X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102897,220962725,,risk and enabl environ in sport systemat dope as harm reduct dope and the use of perform enhanc drug ped are often consid and discuss as separ issu from other type of substanc use by sport bodi politician the media and athlet who use drug themselv howev percept and understand of substanc use in the sport and fit world are direct relat to those of substanc use in the non sport world one way the gap between sport and non sport substanc use research can be bridg is to consid sport risk and enabl environ similar to non sport context and drug use it is import to analys the environ in which dope occur this approach allow us to examin the dynam interplay between risk and enabl factor as the enabl environ shift in respons to chang produc in the risk environ and vice versa there are model of sport environ that have proven effect at both enabl dope by athlet and reduc harm to athlet systemat dope this articl will use secondari literatur in order to review and analys known case of systemat dope through the risk and enabl environ framework we argu that these system respond to anti dope in way that protect athlet from the risk factor establish by anti dope polici and that athlet suffer most when these system were reveal expos athlet to the full rang of dope harm further we argu that risk within these system extort bulli result from the broader prohibit sport environ that forc dope underground and allow such abus to occur,risk and enabling environment in sport systematic doping a harm reduction doping and the use of performance enhancing drug peds are often considered and discussed a separate issue from other type of substance use by sporting body politician the medium and athlete who use drug themselves however perception and understanding of substance use in the sport and fitness world are directly related to those of substance use in the non sport world one way the gap between sport and non sport substance use research can be bridged is to consider sport risk and enabling environment similar to non sport context and drug use it is important to analyse the environment in which doping occurs this approach allows u to examine the dynamic interplay between risk and enabling factor a the enabling environment shift in response to change produced in the risk environment and vice versa there are model of sport environment that have proven effective at both enabling doping by athlete and reducing harm to athlete systematic doping this article will use secondary literature in order to review and analyse known case of systematic doping through the risk and enabling environment framework we argue that these system responded to anti doping in way that protected athlete from the risk factor established by anti doping policy and that athlete suffered most when these system were revealed exposing athlete to the full range of doping harm further we argue that risk within these system extortion bullying resulted from the broader prohibitive sport environment that force doping underground and allows such abuse to occur,"  (0, 300492)	0.07513980738403096
